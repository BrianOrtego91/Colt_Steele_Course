        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">spieces</a> that arose from the red junglefowl, originally
        from
        India.
        They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
        junglefowl,
        and
        green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
        cockerel.
        A
        male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is
        called
        a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.
        Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
        domesticated
        for
        meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of
        2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There
        are
        numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.
